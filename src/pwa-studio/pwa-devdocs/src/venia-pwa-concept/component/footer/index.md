title: Footer component

The footer offers links to areas that are not accessed frequently enough to be in the header but
are still important enough to highlight.

| Description                   | Reference image                                  |

| Footer full                   | ![Footer]{:width="300px"}                        |
{:style="table-layout:auto"}

## Interactions

* **Expanded footer** - appears at the bottom of every page and is reached by scrolling to the bottom
