| Description           | Reference image                    |
| --------------------- | :--------------------------------: |
| Initial button state  | ![Add to cart (1)]{:width="300px"} |

| Product added to cart | ![Add to cart (3)]{:width="300px"} |

## Interactions:

* **Add item** - Button switches to an outline state with a load indicator while the item is being added.
  When the item is added, an animated checkmark replaces the load indicator and the button is re-filled with the initial color.

  The interaction completes with the appearance of a notification/indicator on the header shopping cart icon with the number of items added.
* **Remove item** - An item is removed by deleting it from the mini/shopping cart.
* **Add another item with different configuration** - When the user changes an item parameter, such as size,color, or quantity, the button changes from the checkmark state to the "Add to Cart" original state.
